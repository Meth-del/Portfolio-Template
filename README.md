Portfolio Template 🌐 Professional Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website with dark mode, smooth animations, and a clean corporate design. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎨 Customization

You can personalize the portfolio easily:

Edit content → Change your name, bio, projects, and skills in the data.js file.

Change styling → Modify colors, fonts, or animations in style.css.

Dark/Light Mode → Already included with a toggle button (script.js manages this).

Projects & Skills → Add more items in data.js, and they will appear automatically.
